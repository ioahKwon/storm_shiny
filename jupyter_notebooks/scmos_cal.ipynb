    "## Calibrating an sCMOS camera \n",
    "This notebook explains how to calibrate an sCMOS camera, i.e. how to measure the offset, variance, gain and relative quantum efficiency of each pixel in the camera. The gain is determined under the assumption that the photo-electrons (e-) detected per well are Poisson distributed. This distribution has the property that it's mean is equal to it's variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* The Poisson assumption is not valid for an EMCCD camera due to the excess noise added by the amplification stage. However to a pretty good approximation, the variance scales as twice the mean so you'll get basically the right answer by multiplying the measured gain by 2.\n",
    "* This calibration does not tell you anything about the absolute quantum efficiency of the camera, despite the occasional claim to the contrary.\n"
