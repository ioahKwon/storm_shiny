Storm-Analysis
==============

This is a repository of code developed in the `Zhuang Lab <http://zhuang.harvard.edu/>`_
and the `Babcock Lab <https://hazenbabcock.github.io/>`_ for analysis of STORM
movies. The code is available on `github <https://github.com/ZhuangLab/storm-analysis>`_.

Some algorithms were developed in other groups and ported to Python. In this
case the license applies only to our implementation of the code. If you plan
to use the algorithm in a commercial product you should discuss this with the
original developers.
