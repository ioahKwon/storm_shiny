We typically do this with small fluorescent beads on the order of 0.1um in diameter. The beads are fixed to the coverslip using a buffer with 100mM MgCl2. The coverslip is scanned through the focus in 10nm steps using a piezo z scanner. We assume that the drift in XYZ is neglible during the time it takes to take these movies (10s of seconds).\n",
